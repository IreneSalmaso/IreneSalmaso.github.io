This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
I am currently a post-doc at INAF-OAPd. My research is focussed on [Interacting Supernovae](https://sngroup.oapd.inaf.it/interacting_SNe.html), which typically show narrow lines in their spectra due to the interaction between the SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM) that was ejected by the progenitor in the years before the explosion.  In particular, I am interested in the study of strongly-interacting SNe, whose main powering mechanism is interaction itself, rather than radioactive decay. These energetic transients are characterised by luminous, long-lasting light curves with a broad peak and a slow spectroscopic evolution. They are particularly interesting in the multimessenger context, since strong shock between the fast-expanding SN ejecta and the CSM creates the ideal conditions for particle acceleration and production of high-energy (HE) neutrinos above 1 TeV. I have studied this class of transients during my Ph.D., characterising their energetics and evolution (e.g., [Salmaso et al. 2023, A&A, 673, 127](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2023/05/aa45781-22.pdf)).  During my research, I succesfully led the observative campaign of several SNe at different telescopes and I was also P.I. of three observative proposals at the [Nordic Optical Telescope](https://www.not.iac.es), [Copernico Telescope](https://www.oapd.inaf.it/sede-di-asiago/telescopes-and-instrumentations) in Asiago, and [Very Large Telescope](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/). I have expertise in data reduction and analysis, as well as good coding skills in Python.  I am a member of [NUTS2](https://nuts2.sn.ie/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [ePESSTO+](https://wiki.pessto.org), international collaborations aimed at the classification, study, and characterisation of transients. In this context, I helped with the classification and follow-up of many different kinds of SNe and other stellar transients. I have also joined the [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org) in order to collaborate in the exploitation of the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory for the discovery and follow-up of SNe. Finally, I am also part of [ENGRAVE](http://www.engrave-eso.org) and [GRAWITA](https://grawita.inaf.it), international collaborations aimed at the search of optical counterpart of gravitational waves.
